Sadly, you weren't invited 
==========================
*- a modest submission for Nordic Game Jam 2014*

Sadly, you weren't invited to your niece's wedding day. Last time you spent time together was, quite literally, a disaster. At parties you seem to have a knack for manifesting your presence quite thoroughly, much to the chagrin of the rest of those invited. Frankly, your family is falling apart, your last friend abandoned you sometime in March of last year, unpaid bills are piling up in your condo, and you are all out of toilet paper. Notwithstanding, you decide to go anyway...

The topic for the 2014 Nordic Game Jam was privacy. *Sadly, you weren't invited* explores awkwardness in the physical realm by having the protagonist be a person with little to no sense of propriety. The objective is to sprinkle as much unelegance over the given levels as possible.
